<h1>The Best Movies according to Daddy</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Thing (1982)</h3>
<p>This is my favorite horror movie.<br /> Now, I will point out that I'm not a huge horror movie fan, but this movie hit a little differently.<br />It was creative and the monster was much more ominous and almost like something written by H.P. Lovecraft.<br /> It was creative and made me interested in a lot of themes, movies, and shows that became all-time favorites for me.</p>
<h3>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</h3>
<p>This is by far one of my favorite Disney movies.<br /> Growing up I would watch it all the time and I'll never forget how deep and complex the story arc and characters are.<br /> Something about the movie just kept with me growing up; from the humor to the dark, gruesome reality of the story (that I wouldn't understand until I was older).</p>
<h3>Hotel Transylvania (all the parts)</h3>
<p>This is my favourite cartoon.<br />
    Also a beautiful genre.
